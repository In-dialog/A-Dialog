A)Dialog is a light choreography that allows the user to translate its emotions in splinters of brightness. Glowing spaces emerge, line up, entangle, adjust, calm down, thus creating structural symbols dancing by the beat of the emotional state.
# A Muse EEG device sends  osc raw eeg data that get translated in to excitement level. This level becomes the factor that influences the generation of the visuals
